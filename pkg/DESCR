Pd is a real-time software system for live musical and multimedia
performances. It is in active development by Miller Puckette, and
perhaps others. The system is unfinished, but quite usable for
sophisticated projects. It has been ported to GNU/Linux, MacOS X,
IRIX, BSD, and many flavors of Windows.
